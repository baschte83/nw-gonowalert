# GoNowAlert

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **GoNowAlerts** of class **networks 1** written in Java with my team members Paul Campean and Justina Kluone.

### Requirements
For this assignment we had to write a program for an imaginary courier service which sells and delivers food. The service has a certain adress where it is located. The user can state up to three different adresses where food has to be delivered to. Our programm should use a webservice to generate and compute a route from the adress of the courier service to all places of delivery. It furthermore should compute the total time needed to deliver to all places and at the latest five minutes before a driver of the courier service has to go should it bring three Philips Hue lamps to set of a unique light alarm. In case there is no confirmation of one of the drivers that he recognized this alarm all Philips Hue lamps should blink in a red light.

My work was to get used to the Philips Hue API, to get used to control the Philips Hue lamps and to provide a small, fast and easy-to-use program to generate a simple, unique light alarm and control all Philips Hue lamps in the network lab in our university.
